      the only two players to have played in every TI (thus far). While
      some thought that Puppey would lose strength when his long hair
      was cut, Young P has only endured and come back stronger. Regarded
      to be one of the legendary captains in the game, Puppey has become
      a fixture not only to a powerhouse squad but also in the history
      of Pro DOTA 2.`,

      it smells like durian, Yazied "YapzOr" Jaradat is the whimsical

      Secret from his hometown of Amman, Jordan, from the one internet
      cafe that every professional player out of the region originates
      from (there must be something in the water). Known for his
      aggressive playstyle, Yazied's innovative gameplay never ceases to
      amaze the audience and befuddle opponents. In fact, he's probably
      the only support player that tries for a Rampage every game!`,
